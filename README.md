Welcome to Natours, the one-stop destination for travel and adventures...

This is one of my biggest projects build. The front end is built with the Pug, a completely new technology for me but really interesting. I have used MongoDB as the database which is the most widely used DB that stores the data as JSON. To write the backend I have used Express.js and for the server, Node.js has been used. Postman is used to test APIs.

You can log in/log out of the user and create a new user. For authentication, the JWT(JSON Web Token) is used. To secure the password bcrypt library is implemented. There are currently nine tours that have all the details and reviews. A user can upload the reviews and rate the tour which will be posted on the website.

This is the complete go-to website for the tour organization. This website will be updated constantly. Like logging in with Google and uploading PDFs, updating images, Email authentication, etc. The backend is vast and I would love to delve into it...
